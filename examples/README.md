# Examples

potential minimal examples to make:
- [x] multi-threaded simple monte carlo to estimate pi
- [ ] multi-threaded importance sampling to estimate pi
- [ ] multi-threaded policy gradient example
- [ ] multi-threaded SGD benchmark (requires a thread pool)
- [ ] multi-threaded MCMC (requires update to be implemented)
- [ ] multi-threaded SMC (requires incremental computation)

## simple_monte_carlo

    ./simple_monte_carlo <num_threads> <samples_per_thread>
